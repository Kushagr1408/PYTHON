        "\n",
        "A **Web API (Application Programming Interface)** is a software interface that allows interaction between different applications over the internet using protocols such as HTTP. It defines a set of rules, endpoints, and data exchange formats that allow applications (clients) to communicate with services (servers). A Web API enables developers to access functionalities or data of an application without needing to understand its internal code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Web APIs work using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).\n",
        "- They usually return data in JSON or XML formats.\n",
        "- They allow integration between frontend, backend, mobile apps, and third-party services.\n",
        "- Example: Google Maps API allows developers to embed maps into their applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Short Example (conceptual):**\n",
        "\n",
        "A `GET /users/123` request to an API might return `{'id': 123, 'name': 'Alice'}` in JSON.\n"

        "\n",
        "5. **Faster Development** – Developers can integrate third-party APIs instead of reinventing features (e.g., payments, maps, email).\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Flexibility** – APIs can adapt to multiple devices and clients.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Easier Maintenance** – Centralizing logic behind APIs makes updates easier without changing all clients.\n",
